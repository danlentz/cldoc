  (:documentation "CLDOC XHTML 1.0 Strict driver.

    Use the following options with extract-documentation to customize the
    produced output:
     - :toc-title (or null string): a string that will be used as a title in
       the table of contents. If not given then the toc title will be: Table
       of Contents.
     - :doc-formater (function): a designator for a function of two arguments.
       Its first arguments will be an html-driver instance and its second
       argument will be a list of string that represents each lines of the
       original documentation string. It is expected that this function will 
       output the strings, using the html machinery.
        The default doc-formater has some simple DWIM (Do What I Mean)
       capabilities. It recognizes both indent and empty-line paragraph breaks,
       bulleted lists, code sample, hyper link and sections (like in the
       Hyperspec). The default {defun format-doc} function delegates the 
       DWIM capabilities to the {defclass doctree} class.
     - :filter (or null function): a designator for a function of one argument.
       Its argument will be a symbol-descriptor object. The symbol-descriptor
       will be outputted if and only if this function returns NIL. 
     - :sort-predicate (or null function): a designator for a function of two
       arguments that returns a generalized boolean.
        Predicate should return true if and only if the first argument is
       strictly less than the second (in some appropriate sense). If the first
       argument is greater than or equal to the second (in the appropriate
       sense), then the predicate should return false.
     - :css-pathname (string): a string pathname designator for the css file
       to use in the generated documentation. The default one is the cludg.css
       file delivered with this driver.
     - :charset (string): a string designator for the charset of the generated
       documentation. The default one is: +default-charset+
     - :copy-css-into-output-dir (boolean): if you want the css file to be
       copied in the destination directory. This will allow your created
       documentation to be completely independent of your hard drive
       hierarchy. Otherwise relative reference to the given pathname will be
       generated. Default is set to T. And if :css-pathname is not specified
       the file delivered with CLDOC will simply be copied into the output 
       directory (see :css-pathname).

    All the options supported by the {defclass doctree} class are supported
    when passed to the {defgeneric extract-documentation} method.

    To localise the automatic documentation , if your documentation strings 
    are not in english, the default generation language, you have to modify
    the following variables: 
     - *class-inheritence*
     - *condition-inheritence*
     - *struct-inheritence*
     - *slot-reader-control-string*
     - *slot-writer-control-string*
     - *slot-accessor-control-string*
     - *copier-control-string*
     - *predicate-control-string*
     - *printer-control-string* 
     - *constructor-control-string*"))
