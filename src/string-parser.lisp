  (:documentation "This class will be used to represent the doc string
   structure. Context such as paragraph and bulleted list will be
   repesented as vector block. This is used to retreive the context
   the documentation writer has indicated by its 'Do What I Mean' block.
    It recognizes both indent and empty-line paragraph breaks, bulleted lists,
   code sample, hyper link and sections (like in the Hyperspec).

   For bulleted lists the grammar can be specified using the
  :item-prefix-maker option of the driver. To end itemized list, just add
   a blank line after the last item. The depth of bulleted lists is not
   constrained, but if you start sub bulleted list then a blank line will
   end the current one and all parents at the same time. Otherwise said,
   like here, no other paragraph will be permitted in an item after its
   sub list items.
    The sublists item designator will obey to the following grammar unless
   you have specified your own grammar (see the :item-prefix-maker option):
     - (- ) is the first level of list item prefix.
     - (-- ) is the second level of list item prefix.
     - (--- ) is the third level of list item prefix and so on.

   Use the following options to customize the parser:
   - :item-prefix-maker (function): a designator for a function of one 
     argument. Its argument will be an (integer 1 *) that represents the 
     depth of the list. The return value is the corresponding string prefix
     designator for bulleted list (sublist) items of the specified depth.
   - :code-prefix (string): a string that designates a prefix for code snipet
     insertion in the documentation string. It must prefix all lines of code
     in the documentation string.
     The default value is: {defconstant +default-code-prefix+} .
     For exemple:
     ;;; (defun cludg-sample (bar)
     ;;;   \"How to prefix code snipet in the documentation string:
     ;;;    ;;; (setf *print-case* :downcase)
     ;;;    You are, of course, not limited to one line snipet.\"
     ;;;   (do-nothing))
   - :section-prefix (string): a string that will be used to determine if a 
     section must be started or not if found at the beginning (ignoring left
     whitespaces) of the line. The default value is: 
     {defconstant +default-section-prefix+} .
   - :section-names (string list): a list of string indicating the section
     names. This must be used in conjonction with the section-prefix.
     For instance start a line as follows: '* See Also:'. Default value is:
     {defconstant +default-section-names+} .
   - :link-delimiters (list of two character): a list of two characters that
     indicates the link opening and closing characters. Default value is:
     {defconstant +default-link-delimiters+} . Link grammar:
     [opening-char(URL | defun | defclass | ...)closing-char]. If the hyper
     link can be resolved."))
